Are you and your partner suffering in silence? You're not alone.

* Are you in love with someone you believe may be asexual, or who knows they are?
* Are you wondering how to tell if your partner, lover, husband, or wife is asexual?
* Are you struggling to decide whether to start, continue, or end a relationship?
* Are you healing from a prior relationship with someone who may be asexual?
* Have other books, perhaps even therapy, left you more frustrated and confused?

**Around 1% of the population---more than 70 million people worldwide---may be asexual.**

Many call asexuality the "invisible orientation" because it is still largely unknown and misunderstood, even by therapists. Formal research on this topic is still limited.

Also in the shadows are the sexual people who have built relationships, lives, and families with asexual people---often initially unaware of their differences.

It's a tough time for both partners.

Few self-help books or therapy models account for the unique needs of asexual-sexual couples, or of sexual people who have been impacted by asexuality in their relationships.

This candidly insightful self-help memoir, the first by a sexual partner of an asexual person, addresses this void.
