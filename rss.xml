            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Praise from Experts: Lori Brotto</h1><p>“Outstanding! Elegantly weaves personal exploration with concrete education and scientific data on asexuality. I wish I had this book as a resource to offer several former sexual-asexual couples I have seen in my practice. While written with the sexual partner in mind, it is a valuable book for asexuals who desire romantic attraction as well, as they are most likely to find themselves in partnerships with sexual individuals. This book has provided some concrete recommendations for future clients.”</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/244448fd1a430e7838267d743190cbee5ace0d9e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
